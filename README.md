# JavaScript 30 #2: CSS and JavaScript Clock

A clock that takes in the time from JavaScript and updates the hands based on the current hour, minutes, and seconds.


## Future Iterations

- Fix transition from 59 seconds to 0 seconds. (Right now it rolls backwards around the clock from 59 to 0.)
- Convert to object literal.
